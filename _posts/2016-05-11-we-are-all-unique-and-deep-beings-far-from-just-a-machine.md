description: 'We are all unique and deep beings. Far from just a machine, your body is you, a living being with a thinking mind, a feeling heart, and a spirit that needs nourishing. Everyday our body sends us messages through sensation and feeling, though far too often we do not listen to these messages or know how to tune in with our body to hear them.'

We are all unique and deep beings. Far from just a machine, your body is you, a living being with a thinking mind, a feeling heart, and a spirit that needs nourishing. Everyday our body sends us messages through sensation and feeling, though far too often we do not listen to these messages or know how to tune in with our body to hear them.

**_Have you ever had a "gut feeling" that you trusted? Or didn't and wished you had "gone with your gut"? Have you ever wondered why that "Pain in the Neck" keeps coming back? Feel like your "feet aren't even on the ground?"_**

What we experience in life is mirrored by what we experience in our bodies. Synergy focuses on heightening bodymind awareness to make these connections and actively make choices to change them.
