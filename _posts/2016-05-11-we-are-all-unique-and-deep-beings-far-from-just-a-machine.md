We are all unique and deep beings. Far from just a machine, your body is you, a living being with a thinking mind, a feeling heart, and a spirit that needs nourishing. Everyday our body sends us messages through sensation and feeling, though far too often we do not listen to these messages or know how to tune in with our body to hear them.

What we experience in life is mirrored by what we experience in our bodies. Synergy focuses on heightening bodymind awareness to make these connections and actively make choices to change them.
